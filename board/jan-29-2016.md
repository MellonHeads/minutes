### Guest: Danny from GEA
- Graduate and Undergraduate Entrepeneurship Associations
- Interested in any idea and any cool thing that's going on
- They did Hack-a-Startup (http://www.hackastartup.com/)
  * One winner even dropped out of the MBA program and is now at YCombinator
  * Very cool event, collaboration between MBA/Tepper types and 'hacker' types
  * Next event: Venture Capital Investment Competition (VCIC)
  * Entrepeneurship is discouraged at Tepper - trying to build it up
  * There's no supermassive company that came out of CMU


### Hackathons Demystified II Debrief
- Post-its worked well
  * after a while became less about interaction 
  * however, everyone thought it was super helpful
- Helpful balance of activity and interactivity
- **We (as MellonHeads board) should talk to other people more and clump less!!!**
- Stanford (TreeHacks people) and UC-Davis both are using this now
  * UC-Davis gave a presentation based on Hackathons Demystified (by the same name)
- Best feedback so far... we are improving!
- Entirely different audience than HD1
- Room was the perfect size
- Will was the 'bouncer': we should make this a job
  * stand by the door and make sure people coming in know what's going on
  * hand them a flyer, help them find a seat, etc
  * not a bouncer, but an usher
- Survey the crowd and make sure what school everybody is from
- We should definitely do another one next semester
- Everybody had mad respect for us, energy was super real
- A lot of people idolized us as hackers
  * Make sure to keep it real
  * Talk about the failures too
- Compile all the post-it questions and make a FAQ
- Pitt group got guided over and that was good


### Activities Fair Debrief
- Fall watermellons
- Had the MHacks video on loop and a Google sign-up form
- Got ~70 people to sign up
- Went very well and was pretty chill
- Not many people know what our group is


### Hack-a-song Debrief
- Great that we were involved
- The exact right number of people
  * 40 people -> 7 songs and it worked out well
  * Lowkey, casual, good
- Perfect example of hackathon model applied to something not coding
- Helped our reputation as a group to help other groups run hackathons
- They (accidentally?) released the crappy versions of recordings to Facebook (bad!)


### Hacker Fund Mentor Registration
- Run by the Justins
- Going to post it on the mailing list


### Hima schooling us on funding
- We're getting shit together


### Tiffany talks with Google/Design-only hackathon
- A designer at Google named Geoff Barnes
- 'Sprint week': Design team at Google does a weeklong hackathon, basically
- Talked about School of Design hackathon
- Very open ended
- Possible categories: social good, health, etc
- CMU Hyperloop has design people on it and it's impressive


### Russell and Dramathon
- Write a 10 minute play (beforehand?), submit it to the Dramathon
- Get actors, director, etc. together and go to a room
- Come together and try to as good of a performance as you can
- Hackathon is not writing the play, that happens beforehand
  * during the event is doing everything else
  * getting script -> performance, over the course of a weekend
- Genres: Best Performance, Best Actor, Best Director (per genre)
- Not just School of Drama
- Normally you would have to audition
- When you sign up you say what role you want/what genre
- Sign up in groups?
  * however - being put into groups gives them opportunity to grow
- Projected size: 200 (but split up)
- Projected time: Next year, whatever semester Playground isn't in
- It can't be Playground
- There will be a lot of drama going on
- Not much sponsorship needed?
  * Alumni mentorship
  * Sponsorship from the Tonys for food etc?
  * Someone on/off Broadway as an alum


### Chris and Composer Speed Dating
- Networking event
- Music composition department wants to meet people from other disciplines
- Posted about it in FB group


### Wilson and 3D Printing Event
- Fusion: use their software and get $250
- The AutoDesk Fusion guy will fly out from Boston to do this
- 3D printer for Uber guys want to bring their printers and show them off
- When will it be? 
  * Send the guy an email, find availability, we'll plan it at the next meeting


### Misc.
- Our website is getting mad hits from Google
- We gotta fix the website design
- Re educate people about the potential of what a hackathon could be
- Annelise and yarn hackathon/Mellonhats???
