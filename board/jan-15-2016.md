### Hack to School Review
- that PennApps video was neato: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KnAzBWvuqM 
- waiting on Wilson
- Unstructured “just chill” events are not conducive to bringing in new people
- We need more structure
- Themed events in the future?


### Leap into Hacking
- **February 28th 6:30-8**
- we already have LiveLike VR lined up as a sponsor also (thanks Omar)
- Leap Motion possible sponsor (Omar)
- We need to book the room (Avi) 
- Purpose is to go and learn Leap

### Future events
- Needs to be more structured
- Have a theme (hardware especially, Arduinos etc)
- Segue into doing things that aren’t necessarily technical
- Focus on building a thing for a couple of hours
- Learn new stuff with people
- Teaching people how to learn new things by learning new things along with them
- Bring friends!!!!


### Hackathons Demystified
- We need to figure out how to make sure people are going, because we want them to come
  * Facebook “interested” feature makes things complicated
- Po speaks after all the talks and before pizza
- What talks people want to hear:
  * Facebook poll: coming up with new ideas, balancing schoolwork/hackathons, learning something completely new
  * We need to ask people to do the talks
  * Tiffany’s idea: Post-it notes at the beginning of the event to ask people what they want to hear about
  * We need to define “hackathon terms” FIRST 
    *a cheat sheet of words
    * hosted on the website?
- Pitt chaperone
