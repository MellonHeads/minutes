### Logistics

* Board Members
  * Constitution says we don’t elect until end of spring semester, so we will hold board elections then.
    * 2 phases
      * inform people of this somehow
      * hopefully get people physically in a room to do so, because people don’t read things
  * current board will remain until then
  * open up the ability to run to everyone in the MellonHeads community
* General Body Members
  * need to make form for member sign-up/d-list
    * CMU’s d-list system? Official, but Pitt students can’t be on that list
    * We can set up our own d-list through the website - easy to do
  * “Join” link on website - option to join Facebook group and/or email list
* Money
  * We should apply for student org money from CMU
