    * Dedicated themed meetings for each kind of hardware

        * theme/"special feature” for each meeting

        * Leapmotion, etc

    * Hackathon prep sessions: workshops to teach skills right before hackathons

    * "Before the storm" - teaching sponsor APIs right before big hackathons

    * There’s already a niche for basic webdev etc.

        * nobody does hardware yet? we could do that

    * A lot of expressed interest in doing Hackathons Demystified again

        * post-event hackathon prep session

        * standardized handout w/ basic hackathon info

    * Common hackathon vocabulary event

        * hackathon dictionary 

* Suggestions:

    * We could have had better advertisement - gotten the word out a bit earlier

    * We do have the ability to quickly throw together an event

    * Figure out a way to engage everybody and get introductions happening

        * Icebreakers

* Start planning the next one: now?

    * Hacksgiving

    * Hackmas

* For next time: SIGN UP SHEET

Relations with Pitt:

* Shef and co. doing awesomely

* Things to consider: MH Slack policy?

    * We should have a MellonHeads slack

        * More formal than a Facebook group

    * We should definitely have a main board members comm channel

* Adding Ritwik to Slack

* Their own version of Hackathons Demystified went well!

    * They brought out laptops and had people sign up for PennApps on the spot

Yet More Ideas

* 112 Term project hack session?

Long term vision

* Awesome events like P.Hacktivity that will keep happening month to month (w/ less and less effort on our part as time goes on)

* Big vision: Non-technical hackathons

* Biggest vision: Big awesome meta event (next year?)

    * Truly interdisciplinary "hackathon" (we can’t call it a hackathon)

    * Really different majors collaborating with other people in different majors, us making sure their skills are in line with everything

    * Steps to get there:

        * We have to convince a lot of people to trust us

        * We can do it, it’ll be awesome, and we have a lot of people who really want to do this

        * A lot of smaller events with specific disciplines

        * Infiltrate each department on campus and make an event just for them

        * First: Cog sci event

        * Learn from it, start planning the next one

        * Build relationships with faculty, talk to students, NETWORK

    * Problems:

        * Not very many projects that can facilitate this collaboration? 

* The build-up events

    * Naming and branding: focus on collaboration

    * We can scale up: two/three majors

    * Short list

        * Cog sci

        * Music

        * Design

    * Art + Writing => Storybook hackathon!

        * + Design + Music?

    * Film + Music => epic movie hackathon

    * Approach: solving a problem through the lens of your discipline

        * for cog sci: solve a prompt, design a mobile app, etc

    * We need professor support and mentors 

    * For these small events: 

        * Split up into subcommittees for running them

        * Funding is necessary

        * Partner with other clubs - we need to become experts at running these events

* Competition aspect?

* Timeline:

    * At least one prototype this semester

        * probably cognitive science (smallest and simplest)

    * Next semester: five?

        * Music next semester

        * Storybook next semester

        * Design next semester

        * Also: start planning for the big event next semester

    * Big event next year

* Designate one person to be in charge of each event

MH Website and Github:

* Historian’s writeups on GitHub or website

* Constitution on GitHub or website

* Open source as much as possible

* Website - have a sponsorship pdf similar to PennApps (less intense for now)

* A place to share hackers info - GitHub, website, etc

* Make our website look better

Logistics:

* Form for member sign-up

* Form for running for board positions

* GBM: Voting

* Open up the form at Hacksgiving

* GBM in January
